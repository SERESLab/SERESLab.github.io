1. What sections should we have on the landing page?
2. Do we want to keep the search function (in the top right the magnifying
   glass icon)?
3. Do we want geolocation do be displayed on the website?


Notes:
1. I've put all the HTML files that I believe we don't need to use in a folder called 'outdated',
   we may need to refer to them later if we want to use some structuring/formatting from those files.
2. Though it may seem messy, I've temporarily commented out code that we aren't using in the landing page (index.html)
   in case we want to add another section, we have a formatting foundating if we choose to add another section.
3. Right now the naming conventions/variables are a bit wonky, once the website gets further established
   I will then change them to make them fitting for their purpose and remove the unused.

ToDo:
- contact.html
- Fix video thumbnail size on index.html
- Hook up socials on footer of every page
- hook up contact
- work on the JavaScript POST/PHP
