			  <p>Stack Overflow is very commonly used by software developers to help solve problems 
		they face while working on software tasks such as fixing bugs or building new features. 
		Recent research has explored how the content of Stack Overflow posts affects attraction 
		and how the reputation of users attracts more visitors, however, there is very little 
		evidence on the effect that visual attractors and content quantity direct gaze toward 
		parts of a post, and which part thus holds the attention of a user longer. Moreover, 
		little is known about how these attractors help developers (students and professionals) 
		answer comprehension questions. %In order to understand how developers read and 
		understand Stack Overflow posts, We conducted an eye tracking study on thirty 
		developers constrained to reading only Stack Overflow posts while summarizing 
		four open source API elements. (two methods and two classes) without access to 
		original API source code. Meanwhile, we analyzed the eye movements (via a set of 
		metrics) of developers eye movements while they were reading SO posts. Results 
		indicate that on average text paragraphs and code snippets were fixated on the 
		most often and for the longest by participants. %and votes. Tags were the 
		least read. When ranking pages by the number of appearances of code blocks or 
		paragraphs, we found that while presence of more code blocks did not affect 
		number of fixations, the presence of increasing numbers of plaintext paragraphs 
		significantly drove down the fixations on comments. SO posts that were looked at
		only by students had longer fixation times on code elements within the first 
		ten fixations. We found 16 developers' summaries surpassed our minimum relevance 
		threshold for  terms they read on Stack Overflow used in their summaries. 
		There was no significant difference between professionals and students on how 
		often they transitioned up or down a page.  In the end, we discuss the implications 
		of such reading behavior on how SO questions, answers, and comments could benefit 
		from being structured.</p>
