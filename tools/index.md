### iTrace Infrastructure - Enabling Eye Tracking in Developer Environments
Software developers work with many source code files but each of these files typically is comprised of thousands of lines of code. They constantly flip through multiple files while reading and debugging code. Current state-of-the-art eye tracking software works well on fixed stimuli such as images but does not support tracking of developer gazes on these semantically and syntactically rich source code artifacts. Since source code files are really large, we cannot feasibly draw AOIs around each element to map gaze data to those regions. iTrace, our eye tracking infrastructure solves these problems making it easier for one to get started on conducting eye tracking studies in software engineering and related fields.
